# Obsidian Weekly Notes Plugin

A daily note creation plugin that uses different templates for each day of the week.

This is my first attempt at making an Obsidian plugin. This might just be the worst code I've ever written, but it works at an absolute minimum how I kinda wanted it to. I did this for learning purposes and this repo is only for my future reference, please don't use this plugin.

There is no saving this project. The desired behavior is achieved in a much better and more proper way by the existing [Periodic Notes Plugin by Liam Cain](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes). I've already switched to this, and it's wonderful.
